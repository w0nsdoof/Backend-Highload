# Fault Tolerance Strategies

## Architectural Resilience
Implementing robust fault tolerance mechanisms to ensure system reliability and continued operation during component failures.

### Load Balancing Resilience
```nginx
upstream e-commerce {
    server django-1:8000;
    server django-2:8000;
    server django-3:8000;
}
```
- If one Django instance fails, traffic routes to remaining healthy instances
- Ensures continuous service availability

### Database Failover
- Primary PostgreSQL database
- Read replica for redundancy
- Ability to switch between databases

### Asynchronous Task Handling
```python
@shared_task(bind=True)
def process_order_creation(self, user_id, cart_items):
    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            # Transactional order processing
    except Exception as e:
        # Robust error handling
        self.retry(exc=e, max_retries=3)
```

### Celery Task Retry Mechanism
- Automatic retry for failed tasks
- Configurable retry attempts
- Prevents complete task failure

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Prometheus for system health tracking
- Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Immediate detection of potential issues

### Redis Caching as Resilience Layer
- Provides fallback data storage
- Reduces direct database dependency
- Improves system responsiveness during partial failures

### Key Fault Tolerance Strategies
1. Redundant Services
2. Graceful Degradation
3. Error Isolation
4. Automatic Recovery Mechanisms

### Considerations
- Implement circuit breakers
- Design for stateless services
- Use distributed tracing
- Comprehensive logging
