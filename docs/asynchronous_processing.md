# Asynchronous Processing

## Celery Task Queue
Asynchronous processing is crucial for maintaining application responsiveness and handling time-consuming tasks efficiently. In this project, Celery is strategically utilized to manage background tasks.

### Key Asynchronous Tasks
1. **Email Notifications**
   ```python
   @shared_task
   def send_email_task(subject, message, recipient_list):
       send_mail(subject, message, settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER, recipient_list)
   ```

2. **Order Processing**     
   Is not implemented yet in view, but exists in order.tasks.py
   ```python
   @shared_task(bind=True)
   def process_order_creation(self, user_id, cart_items):
       task_id = self.request.id
       try:
           with transaction.atomic():
               # Complex order processing logic
               # Includes stock validation, user retrieval, etc.
       except ValidationError as e:
           # Error handling
   ```

### Benefits of Asynchronous Processing
- Prevents blocking of main application thread
- Improves overall system responsiveness
- Enables efficient handling of time-consuming operations
- Provides better user experience by processing tasks in the background

### Configuration
```python
# Celery configuration
app = Celery('config')
app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')
app.autodiscover_tasks()
```

### Use Cases
- Sending confirmation emails
- Processing complex orders
- Generating reports
- Performing background calculations
